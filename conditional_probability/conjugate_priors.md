# Conjugate Priors

Suppose we have data with likelihood function f(A|B) depending on a hypothesized parameter. Also suppose the prior distribution for B is one of a family of parametrized distributions. If the posterior distribution for B is in this family then we say the prior is a **conjugate prior** for the likelihood.

- **Pararmetrized distribution** - Simply put, parametrization (or parameterization) is where you change certain aspects a probability distribution by tweaking its parameters.
