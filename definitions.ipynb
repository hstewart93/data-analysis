    "A **set** $S$ is a collection of elements. We use the following notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Element**: We write $x \\in S$ to mean the element $x$ is in the set $S$.\n",
    "- **Subset**: We say the set $A$ is a subset of $S$ if all of its items are in $S$. We write this as $A \\subset S$.\n",
    "- **Complement**: The complement of $A$ in $S$ is the set of elements of $S$that are not in $A$. We write this as $A^C$ or $S - A$.\n",
    "- **Union**: The union of $A$ and $B$ is the set of all elements in $A$ **or** $B$ (or both). We write this as $A \\cup B$.\n",
    "- **Empty set**: The empty set is the set with no elements. We denote it $\\emptyset$.\n",
    "- **Disjoint**: $A$ and $B$ are disjoint if they have no common elements. That is, if $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\n",
    "- **Difference**: The difference of $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements in $A$ that are not in $B$. We write this as $A-B$."

    "A **permutation** of a set is a particular ordering of its elements. For example, the set $\\{a, b, c\\}$ has six permuations: $abc, acb, bac, cab, cba$. We found the number of permutations by listing them all. We could also have found the number of permuations by using the **rule of product**. That is, there are 3 ways to pick the first element, then 2 ways for the second, and 1 for the first. This gives a total of $3\\cdot2\\cdot1=6$ permuations.\n",
